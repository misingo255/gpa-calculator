# GPA Calculator
A simple project to help me brush up on my CSS and HTML, and practice some new JS concepts.

I wanted to build this using OOP, but damn, it's hard. So I switched back to writing spaghetti code. Maybe I'll try to implement that in the future, but for now, functions will do.

I have utilized HTML templates. Instead of creating nodes with Javascript, I just activate a template everytime I need a new element rendered in the UI. I don't think I'll ever go back to `document.createShittyCode()`

Features:
- [x] GPA Calculation in 4.0 scale.
- [ ] GPA Calculation in any scale. Users can customize the calculator using built in settings.
- [ ] Basic UI animations and microinteractions animations
